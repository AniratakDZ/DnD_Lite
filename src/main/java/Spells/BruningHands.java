    Burning Hands
    1st-level evocation
    Casting Time: 1 action
    Range: Self (15-foot cone)
    Components: V, S
    Duration: Instantaneous
    As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers
    spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must
    make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire
    damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
    successful one.
    The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that
    aren’t being worn or carried.
    At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
    spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by
    1d6 for each slot level above 1st
